        <h3><center><b>a bit about me...</b></center></h3>
          <p>I graduated with a masters degree in Music- focusing on music theory and vocal pedagogy. I spent 2 years in Europe singing on the stages of opera houses like Deutsche Oper in Berlin, Graz Opernhaus in Graz, and the Semperoper in Dresden. I speak fluent German. After returning to Seattle, I began learning programming on the side as a personal interest. Personal interest grew into a desire to make programming my full time job.</p>
          <p1>In my free time, I enjoy backpacking, climbing, cycling, or pretty much anything which allows me to spend time in the wilderness
