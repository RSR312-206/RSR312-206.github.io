        <h3><b>a bit about me...</b></h3>
          <p>I graduated with a masters degree in Music- focusing on music theory and vocal pedagogy. After spending time in Europe singing on the stages of opera houses like Deutsche Oper in Berlin, Graz Opernhaus in Graz, and the Semperoper in Dresden. I speak fluent German. After returning to Seattle, I began learning programming on the side as a personal interest. Personal interest grew into a desire to make programming my full time job.</p>
          <p1>In my free time, I enjoy backpacking, climbing, cycling, or pretty much anything which allows me to spend time in the wilderness</p1>
